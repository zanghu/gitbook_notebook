### 1.首先安装anaconda

安装完成后需要在~/.bashrc中配置如下内容, 否则后面编译caffe的make all过程可能会报错

```shell
export ANACONDA_HOME=/home/zanghu/ProgramFiles/software/anaconda2

# added by Anaconda2 installer
export PATH="ANACONDA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$ANACONDA_HOME/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$ANACONDA_HOME/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

export LIBRARY_PATH=$ANACONDA_HOME/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ANACONDA_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

注意  
切勿单独安装或使用apt-get安装opencv, 因为opencv也依赖potocol buffers, 可能与annaconda的peotocolbuffers出现版本冲突, 导致make runtest失败.

### 2.进入caffe官方网站安装说明页：[http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install\_apt.html](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html)

需要安装的安装依赖项:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libhdf5-serial-dev
```

不能安装的依赖项:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libopencv-dev protobuf-compiler
```

如果没有单独安装boost, 可以考虑用如下方法安装, 如果已经安装则无需再次安装

```shell
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
```

### 3.编译caffe

首先拉取git最新版源码

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
cd caffe
```

其次配置配置文件Makefile.config

```shell
## Refer to http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

再次编译源码和测试用例

```shell

make test -j8
```
