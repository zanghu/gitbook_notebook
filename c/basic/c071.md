## C: 常量表达式的理解

按照`ISO C`的叙述，C语言中共有五类整型：`char`、`short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`

其中除了`char`之外的四类，默认都是`signed`，即有符号数。

`char`默认是有符号数还是无符号数，由实现决定。

C99 N1256 draft 6.2.5/15 "Types" has this to say about the signed-ness of type char:

The implementation shall define char to have the same range, representation, and behavior as either signed char or unsigned char.

and in a footnote:

CHAR_MIN, defined in <limits.h>, will have one of the values 0 or SCHAR_MIN, and this can be used to distinguish the two options. Irrespective of the choice made, char is a separate type from the other two and is not compatible with either.
