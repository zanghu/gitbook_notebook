In C language, objects with static storage duration have to be initialized with constant expressions, or with aggregate initializers containing constant expressions.

A "large" object is never a constant expression in C, even if the object is declared as `const`.

Moreover, in C language, the term "constant" refers to literal constants (like `1`, `'a'`, `0xFF` and so on), enum members, and results of such operators as `sizeof`. Const-qualified objects (of any type) are not constants in C language terminology. They cannot be used in initializers of objects with static storage duration, regardless of their type.

For example, this is NOT a constant

```c
const int N = 5; /* `N` is not a constant in C */
```
The above `N` would be a constant in C++, but it is not a constant in C. So, if you try doing

```c
static int j = N; /* ERROR */
```
you will get the same error: an attempt to initialize a static object with a non-constant.

This is the reason why, in C language, we predominantly use `#define` to declare named constants, and also resort to `#define` to create named aggregate initializers.
