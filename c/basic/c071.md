In C language, objects with static storage duration have to be initialized with constant expressions, or with aggregate initializers containing constant expressions.

C语言中，静态存储的对象必须使用***常量表达式***进行初始化，或者使用常量表达式的复合形式进行初始化。

A "large" object is never a constant expression in C, even if the object is declared as `const`.

C语言中结构体类型对象不能被看作是常量表达式，即便该对象被关键字`const`修饰。

Moreover, in C language, the term "constant" refers to literal constants (like `1`, `'a'`, `0xFF` and so on), enum members, and results of such operators as `sizeof`. Const-qualified objects (of any type) are not constants in C language terminology. They cannot be used in initializers of objects with static storage duration, regardless of their type.

更进一步，在C语言中，“常量”这个词的含义仅包含字面常量（例如：`1`，`'a'`，`0xFF`等）、枚举值（由关键字`enum`定义）和`sizeof`运算符的计算结果。从术语角度，被关键字`const`修饰的对象（不管类型如何）并不是C语言的常量，因此`const`修饰的对象不能被用于初始化静态存储的对象，这一点与其类型无关。

For example, this is NOT a constant

```c
const int N = 5; /* `N` is not a constant in C */
```
The above `N` would be a constant in C++, but it is not a constant in C. So, if you try doing

```c
static int j = N; /* ERROR */
```
you will get the same error: an attempt to initialize a static object with a non-constant.

This is the reason why, in C language, we predominantly use `#define` to declare named constants, and also resort to `#define` to create named aggregate initializers.
